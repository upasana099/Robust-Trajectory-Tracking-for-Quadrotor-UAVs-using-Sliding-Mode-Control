# Robust-Trajectory-Tracking-for-Quadrotor-UAVs-using-Sliding-Mode-Control
This project focuses on designing a sliding mode controller for altitude and attitude control of the Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotor. The goal is to enable the quadrotor to track desired trajectories and visit a set of desired waypoints. The project is built on Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic.
